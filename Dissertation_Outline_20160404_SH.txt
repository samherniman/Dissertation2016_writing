		What is Maximum Entropy?
			Fig. 1
		What is MAXENT?
			ROC analysis
			Presence only data
			Environmental variables 
			Regularisation
		What can it be used for?
			Assessing the possible spread of invasive species 
			Climate change outlooks for at risk species 
			Discovering new populations of a species 
			Determining areas of conservation concern and the most appropriate reserve boundaries 
			Assessing potential areas for reintroductions and translocations 
		Where it falls short
			Sampling bias
			Range
		Conclusions
