  "name": "The Anthropogenic Influences on two Chinese Orchids",
  "tagline": "A study in MAXENT",
  "body": "The tropical forests of Xishuangbanna are one of the most biodiverse regions of China. Within the last 20 years, 22% of the land has been converted to rubber plantation and tea resulting in large scale fragmentation and habitat loss. In addition, Xishuangbannaâ€™s close proximity to Myanmar, Laos and Vietnam means that it is a hub for wildlife trade, threatening many species in the region.\r\nWith over 400 orchid species of 115 genera, Xishuangbanna holds 31% of all Chinese orchids. Orchids are habitat specialists due to their specific pollinators and mycorrhizal associations, and are often vulnerable to many anthropogenic activities. Of these 400, 3 have been classified as possibly extinct in the wild, 15 Critically Endangered, 82 as Endangered and 124 as Vulnerable, regionally.\r\nIn this study we examine the distribution of two species that are thought to be threatened by both habitat loss and trade for horticultural use: Luisia magniflora and Dendrobium thyrsiflorum. Both species are classified as Endangered in a regional Red listing assessment yet little is known about their habitat requirements or distribution. Using existing presence data from digital herbarium records and ecological surveys in Xishuangbanna over the last five years, we produced habitat suitability models of these species using MAXENT. Environmental predictors such as distance to roads, water and settlements, as well as altitude, land cover, canopy cover, aspect, precipitation and daytime temperature were taken into account.\r\nOur results show areas of high probability of presence and we identify environmental factors influencing the distribution of the species. We also highlight the areas of high conservation concern by modeling the future distribution of tea and rubber plantations with MAXENT. By overlaying the existing protected area network onto the distribution maps we can assess the efficacy of protected area coverage.",
