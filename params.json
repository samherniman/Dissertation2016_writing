  "body": "The main document of my dissertation on orchid distributions This dissertation was submitted to Bangor University as part of a degree in Applied Terrestrial and Marine Ecology on 20160504 This is in an attempt to use open science philosophies in the greatest possible way during my dissertation writing. Sadly, this cannot be extended to the whole of the dissertation as much of the raw data is not my own.\r\n\r\nThe tropical forests of Xishuangbanna are one of the most biodiverse regions of China. Within the last 20 years, 22% of the land has been converted to rubber plantation and tea resulting in large scale fragmentation and habitat loss. In addition, Xishuangbannaâ€™s close proximity to Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam means that it is a hub for wildlife trade, threatening many species in the region. With over 400 species, Xishuangbanna holds 31% of all Chinese orchids. Orchids are habitat specialists due to their specific pollinators and mycorrhizal associations, and are often vulnerable to many anthropogenic activities. We examine the distribution of Luisia magniflora and Dendrobium thyrsiflorum, two species that have been classified as endangered in a regional red listing assessment. Little is known about their habitat requirements or distribution. Using existing presence data from surveys in Xishuangbanna and environmental variables, we produce habitat suitability models of these species using MAXENT. Jackknife tests highlight the distributional influence of two anthropogenic environmental variables on these species, lights at night (a proxy for settlement locations) and distance to roads (a proxy for wild harvesting ability), suggesting that these species are disturbed by wild harvesting. Jackknife tests also highlight the preference of both species for certain moisture levels, and Dendrobium thyrsiflorum for certain altitudes. We highlight that a multifaceted approach to reducing wild harvesting pressure and conserving these species is needed and demonstrate the robustness of MAXENT.",
