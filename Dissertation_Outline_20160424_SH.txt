	MAXENT
		What is Maximum Entropy?
			Fig. 1
		What is MAXENT?
			ROC analysis
			Presence only data
			Environmental variables 
			Regularisation
		What can it be used for?
			Assessing the possible spread of invasive species 
			Climate change outlooks for at risk species 
			Discovering new populations of a species 
			Determining areas of conservation concern and the most appropriate reserve boundaries 
			Assessing potential areas for reintroductions and translocations 
		Where it falls short
			Sampling bias
			Range
		Conclusions
Aims and objectives
1.	Where are the orchids?
2.	What factors determine the distribution of these orchids?
3.	What is the greatest threat to these orchids?
4.	Make suggestions to aid in cons

Discussion
	What did this study do?
	Why? How is this different?
	What has this contributed?
	signpost
	
	
	
	XSBN is a rapidly changing area - this is only a snapshot
	Orchid distribution
	ROC curves
	AUC values
	Factors determining distribution/layers
	
	Ways to improve the model
		higher resolution (ref lm)
		lidar - unavailable to non gov
		PCA
		distance to rivers
		unsupervised calssification
		bioclim
		greater number of presence points - very low return on investment
		machine learning
	Bias
	
	What's next?
		ENM tools
	Threats to orchids
		climate change rubber
	Why does this matter?
	What does this teach us?
	Assumptions of Habitat suitablility models
Conclusion
	What should we do?
		assisted migration? Hewitt (2011)
