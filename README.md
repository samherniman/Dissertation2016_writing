# Dissertation2016_writing
The main document of my dissertation on orchid distributions
This dissertation was submitted to Bangor University as part of a degree in Applied Terrestrial and Marine Ecology on 20160504
This is in an attempt to use open science philosophies in the greatest possible way during my dissertation writing.
Sadly, this cannot be extended to the whole of the dissertation as much of the raw data is not my own.
